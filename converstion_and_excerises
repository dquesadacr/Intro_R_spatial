We can include one slide in the beginning about data types and dimesion in reality. From my point of view, there is a lack of understanding about data dimensionality

river flow > 1D 
temperature and precipitation is 1D 
temperature map is 2D data 
atmospheric or oceanic or soil data is 3D, lo, lat, and level 


Thinking of an exercise that can teach the students programming and not scripting: 
1. We can start with csv files and time series analysis. 
    For example, a csv files containing minimum, maximum, and average temperature as well as other climate variable from the area of interest that the student choose. Preferably, hourly or daily data. 
    Tasks should be: 
        1. Reading the csv file, 
        2. Plotting time series with r base and r ggplot2 
        3. Data aggregation to monthly, seasonally, annually
        4. Plus trend analysis
