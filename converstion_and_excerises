We can include one slide in the beginning about data types and dimesion in reality. From my point of view, there is a lack of understanding about data dimensionality

river flow > 1D 
temperature and precipitation is 1D 
temperature map is 2D data 
atmospheric or oceanic or soil data is 3D, lo, lat, and level 

TASK ONE: 
    1. Pick a location (i.e. longitude and latitude), where you want to apply your analysis.
    2. use the function get_ts_as_csv to get your csv files (i.e. time series)
    3. Use the following files to obtain the climatic variables: 
       1. Surface wind: sfcWind_day_MPI-ESM-MR_historical_r1i1p1_19760101-20051231.nc
       2. Surface temperature: tas_day_MPI-ESM-MR_historical_r1i1p1_19760101-20051231.nc
       3. Precipitation: 
       4. pr_day_MPI-ESM-MR_historical_r1i1p1_19760101-20051231.nc
    4. Use the emission scenario you would like to analyze. for example, RCP26, RCP45 and finally RCP85.
    5. Plotting of the time series for different periods, i.e. 2031-2060 & 2071-2100.
    6. Data Aggregation, to monthly seasonally, and annually is required. 
    7. You can perform trend analysis or any type of time series analysis you would like.  

TASK TWO: 
2D maps 



Thinking of an exercise that can teach the students programming and not scripting: 
1. We can start with csv files and time series analysis. 
    For example, a csv files containing minimum, maximum, and average temperature as well as other climate variable from the area of interest that the student choose. Preferably, daily data. 
    Tasks should be: 
        1. Reading the csv file, 
        2. Plotting time series with r base and r ggplot2 
        3. Data aggregation to monthly, seasonally, annually
        4. Plus trend analysis
