Thinking of an exercise that can teach the students programming and not scripting: 
1. We can start with csv files and time series analysis. 
    For example, a csv files containing minimum, maximum, and average temperature as well as other climate variable from the area of interest that the student choose. Preferably, hourly or daily data. 
    Tasks should be: 
        1. Reading the csv file, 
        2. Plotting time series with r base and r ggplot2 
        3. Data aggregation to monthly, seasonally, annually
        4. Plus trend analysis
